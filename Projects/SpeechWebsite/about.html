               Hi, my name is Sunny and I am currently an eighth grader at Ereckson Middle School. I started public speaking in the first grade, and I have been awarded two-time top speaker and tournament champion in a fusion of public forum and IPDA debate and have placed first in the district-wide impromptu speaking UIL competition. In addition, I have worked under the tutelage of Team USA world schools debaters and state-wide high school champions. I founded this club with the intention of curating a community full of passionate, confident speakers who empower each other through a variety of speech and debate activities. I am dedicated to providing high-quality guidance (and a good time :D) to all members of the club. Outside of debate, I am an award-winning cellist and enjoy playing tennis, making weird desserts, and spending time with friends. I am incredibly grateful for all of my fellow officers, our incredible sponsors, and all of our members for making this club possible. I am excited to serve as your 2022-23 Ereckson S&D president and will do my best to utilize my efforts to make a positive impact on our school community!

Debate Director

            <p>
Hi, my name is Saanvi Chepyala and I am currently an 8th grader at ereckson middle school.
I started off in third grade with a love for informative writing and speaking, placing in district-wide writing competitions for 3 consecutive years. In 2020 I dived into the argumentative field of speaking, debate. I’ve attended many classes taught by instructors who are finalists and winners of national competitions held by Stanford, Harvard, NSDA, and many more. Not only have I entered competitions for public forum debate, but I’ve had the opportunity to give a speech to hundreds of entrepreneurs and engineers at Texas Instruments. My passion is to be able to create a competitive s&d atmosphere at Ereckson while developing speech and debate throughout the community of Allen. Debate gives you a life long partner and a lifelong friend. I want to see people keep these lasting bonds while entering competitions and earning the satisfaction of not only winning but learning too. Outside of speech and debate, I’m an active tennis player, a leader of the Ereckson Robotics team as well as Hope Squad, a decent viola player :p, and someone who likes to keep a smile on their face, no matter how cheesy that may sound :)). I’m excited to be the 22-23 Debate Director and an officer of Ereckson Speech and Debate!

            <p>
             Hi, I’m Ananya Jamdagneya, and I’m an eighth grader at Ereckson middle school. I started public speaking in third grade and fell in love with it. Then a year later I decided to try different styles of speaking. For the next 2 years, I met mentors that won national debate championships and multiple national debate participants. They taught me everything I know about the debate today. The skills I learned from these endeavors were Extemp. Debate, General Speaking and impromptu speaking. Along with this, I’ve been the president of my public speaking club called Toastmasters for the past year. This club helped me realize public speaking is more than something my parents wanted me to do, it's a club I genuinely enjoy. I want to spread this love in Ereckson through the debate club. I have won multiple district-wide oral championships and have also won multiple Toastmaster speaking awards for my impromptu speaking. Along with this I have participated in multiple debate competitions. My goal is to make this club a safe place for everyone to learn and absorb knowledge and make public speaking something that everybody can do. Aside from speech and debate I also participate in many other Ereckson clubs including BEST robotics, PALS, and TMSCA, and became an Ereckson NJHS representative this past year. I also enjoy playing basketball and am on the Ereckson team. I am really excited to dive into a year full of debate and fun in the 2022-23 school year!

            <p class="fst-italic">
            Impromptu/Extemporaneous Director
            </p>
            <p>
             Hi, my name is Anton Joseph, and I am an 8th grader at Ereckson Middle School. This year, I am an officer in Speech and Debate, and I am so thrilled to be able to. There are many reasons why I chose to teach in this club, but the main reason is my passion for speaking. Speaking has always been something that has come naturally to me. Whether it was arguing with my brother, or participating in UIL, I never doubted my ability to speak, and convey messages. I don’t consider myself the best at speaking, but I do feel that I have an above average speaking ability. I did my first bit of public speaking when I was in 3rd grade. All students were tasked to write a speech for Veterans Day, and I was told to speak mine aloud in front of our school since mine was the best in the grade. After that, I did impromptu speaking for UIL in our school district along with some of the members in this club. In the final competition however, no other schools participated, making me and my club mates have to face each other for the UIL. In the end I placed 2nd out of 3 people. Yeah, not an amazing achievement, but I’m still proud of it.  I haven't professionally done speaking in tournaments and competitions, and I haven’t attended classes for it. Everything I know was self-taught, but I don’t consider that a disadvantage. Even with my lack of education, I’m still able to keep up with the best speakers in our school with speeches for classes and other activities. To be honest, if my resume for public speaking was compared to others in the club, it would be ranked dead last. But it's okay. I know that so many kids coming into this club have no formal experience, and some aren’t self-taught. This makes teaching them all the more fun and better, as I can relate to new members more and more. Along with Speech Debate, other clubs I'm doing this year include BEST Robotics and TMSCA. Both of these clubs I did last year as well. For the people who actually read through my insanely long bio,(sry for it btw) I do want to tell one last thing. When I was told to write this bio, I procrastinated A LOT. Because of that I owe some of my club members boba, lol. When I started writing, I decided that I wasn’t gonna make myself look like a Grade A, future valedictorian student, because I'm not. I told the truth, maybe even dumbed it down a little, so that all of you who read this know that you don’t have to be a valedictorian to join this club. You don’t need to go to Harvard in the future, have 100s in all your classes, or even have past experience in Speech and Debate. You can join for whatever reason you want. And we will still have fun, either which way.

             Welcome to EMS speech and debate, my name is Betty Liu, a fellow eighth grader at Ereckson Middle School. I am the General officer and Social Media Director of this club. Most of my experience in debate lies in public forums. Throughout the two years I have been learning debate, I participated in two camp tournaments both virtual and in-person from the Plano West Debate camp. This camp is a great way to build up your experience in debate and speech. I also have been learning both speech and debate for 2 years with the debate team coach of Rice Middle school. With this club, I want to help increase Allen’s participation in debate and speech. I believe that the art of debating can enhance your speaking and writing skills. Outside of debate, I am a member of the Ereckson BEST robotics team, a multi award winning dancer at Happyfeet dance school, a piano player, and treasurer of NiHao Food Bank. Allen shall grow with the focus of instructing students in the art of speech and debate starting at Ereckson.

               What people call you is consequential and is what defines you. I have many names but the one that is key to you, is Abhirama Sonny. I have debate experience but my area of expertise is in Tech. As co-director of Speech and debate tech, I excel in coding, engineering and computer science. Besides Speech and Debate, I am proficient at chess. I have a blitz rating of 1324 and used to be 35th best in tx for age 12. I am also in TMSCA and got to state. In order to qualify for state, you need to succeed in several rigorous regional competitions. I started public speaking in 3rd grade when my mom enrolled me in a camp (without my knowledge) which helped me not be shy and speak out more. At Debate Club, we edify you on how to indite a speech well and perform it. You also learn how to debate effectively and have several round opportunities to hone your skills to the best of your ability. I am excited to join this club so I can get the opportunity to have fun while at the same time learning about speech and debate.

              If your job is to live life, then my job is to make it better. An experienced speaker, having hundreds of hours on the workfront serving customers of all ages, I have found a place where I can hone my abilities and put them to their highest usage. As a fellow and loyal eight-grade student of Ereckson middle school, I am devoted to enhancing the social and learning environment around me. This club allows me to do that. With experience in speech, I have also dedicated time to other hobbies. I have coded and designed a website for the award winning Ereckson Robotics Team, and have learned under the guidance of highly trained mentors. Outside of academics, I have forged my path to claim a black belt at White Tiger Martial Arts, and partake in their award-winning Demonstration Team. These activities have trained me to become friendly with the people around me, and I hope to utilize this trait to the fullest while serving as a 2022-2023 Speech and Debate Officer. With a fertile and comfortable learning environment in the foreseeable future, Speech and Debate Club shall truly be a something that you enjoy.
